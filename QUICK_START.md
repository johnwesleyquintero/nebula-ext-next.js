# Quick Start Guide

To quickly get started with development:

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

If you encounter any issues:
1. Make sure all dependencies are installed correctly
2. Check that no other service is running on port 3000
3. Clear the `.next` cache folder:
   ```bash
   rm -rf .next
   npm run dev
   ```
